_Using the power of Rust to add a cute crab to your Github Contributions for the current year! 🦀_

&nbsp;

## Why does this exist?
1. Crabs are cute.
2. I wanted to try Rust which I enjoyed very much.
3. Github Contributions is a horrible way to track experience so the crab protects you from recruiters that see an empty contributions graph and immediately discard you (not guaranteed to work).

## Why are Github Contributions a horrible way to track experience?
- They don't track projects you contribute to outside of Github. _(Example: 10 years fulltime work experience in GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted git services)_
- They don't track non-coding contributions. _(Example: DevOps, Documentation, Design, Management, etc.)_
- They can be easily gamed. _(Example: Making trivial commits to inflate your contributions graph or adding a crab, pff who would do that)_
